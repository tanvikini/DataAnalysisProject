Analyzing the effect of air quality on the number of UFO Sightings in the US

This is a project to learn how to analyze a given dataset and come up with the model that fits it best.
We chose a challenging dataset with a binary response variable.

The final model we obtained was a Logistic Regression model. With this, for a given SO2 concentration of SO2 in the air (SO2 Air Quality Index)
and a given year, we can now make a prediction as to whether or not we would see a UFO sighting.
